# Webscrape
---

WebScrape is a data mining tool tailored to grabbing professor 
and comment data from ratemyprofessors.com for later processing.
Currently, the program scrapes text from a webpage, and acquires
the professor name. A directory is created and named after the 
professor in question. Next, the comment section is located, and a file is created for each
comment. 
I am considering using SQLite to manage data going forward. Complete implementation of SQLite
depends on the results of my own research. 

See NEXT STEPS section at the bottom of this file for more information regarding future updates

## NEXT STEPS: 
##### (from highest-priority to lowest)
---
* Gather complete data (not just first 20 entries) 
* Become OS-agnostic (May already be achieved)
* Scrape multiple pages in one run
* Convert to SQLite
* Support Vector Machine.
